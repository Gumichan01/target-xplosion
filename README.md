Target Xplosion is a shoot'em up video game.

The main purpose of this project is to make a modular, and customizable game, with different enemies and missiles. 
The game was developed in C++, and uses [LunatiX\_engine](https://github.com/Gumichan01/lunatix-engine) and Lua scripts.

## Demo ##

A first demo is available [here] (https://github.com/Gumichan01/target-xplosion/wiki/Introduction#download) 
You can get the current developement game thanks to the source code.
