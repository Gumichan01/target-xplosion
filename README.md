## Compilation ##

 The game depends on the LunatiX engine and TinyXML2. 
The TinyXML2 library is provided, but you need to generate the library file of 
the engine to compile the game.  
 These files are provided for the Windows version and can be used without 
any problems. Even though you can find an equivalent of that for Linux, there is no
warranty of compilation success.

 Please take a look on The LunatiX engine README. The different libraries used by
the engine must be installed. It is not necessay to do that on Windows, because 
all of them are provided.

To compile, you just need to execute the following command:  
 *$make*
