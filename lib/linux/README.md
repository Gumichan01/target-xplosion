**NB**: This is the default location where you must put *libLunatix.a* *libLunatix.so*
in order to link the source code of Target Xplosion with those files,
if you did not install LunatiX on your computer.

If you installed LunatiX on your computer, you just need to provide the directory where
the library is installed in the Makefile.

Those two library files must be generated by building LunatiX.
